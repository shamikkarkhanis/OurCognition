### Project Summary

OurCognition is a web application designed to illustrate how various cognitive disorders and diseases impact the brain and disrupt the flow of information. By enabling users to explore a timeline for each disorder, the platform highlights affected brain regions, explains the impact on information processing, and connects these insights to real-world implications for patients.

OurCognition has the potential to become a leading tool for visualizing cognitive disorders and their impact on the brain. By integrating user feedback and advancing its feature set, the platform can scale into a versatile educational resource. Future updates will prioritize enhanced interactivity, detailed visualizations, and expanded content to meet the needs of diverse users.
